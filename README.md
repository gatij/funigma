# funigma
Encryption of string(messages) using developed algorithm . 
A python module that can encode your important messages into cipher so no one can easily crack your secret out.
This repo is to demonstrate the basic principle of cryptography and also show its real life application in fun mode.
working flow: 

1.message

2.convert to string

3.Encrypt using Funigma Algorithm (Now become unreadableSo it is called secret.)

4.copy this secret 

5.send to destination

6.decrypt using Funigma

7.original message

                                                                                   
So anyone without Funigma can not decode your message evenif your communication is intercepted. 

NOTE:Never tell anyone except the destination that you are using funigma encryption otherwise you will be hacked easily.
